## Work in progress 
Baby Yoda Discord Bot

The bot does what most popular bots do. Nothing special. I created it to be used on my personal discord server with my friends. 

 ## So why go through the effort?

Mostly, because it's fun and I enjoy it. But my favourite best part is - The Discord bot is hosted on a Vultr instance (an online VPS service), that is provisioned with terraform and Github actions for a seamless CI/CD experience. Once new code is merged into the main branch, it will automatically be deployed to the live bot within 1 minute.
